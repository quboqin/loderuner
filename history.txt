⏺ Lode Runner Game Design

  Core Game Components & Architecture

  Game Entities

  - Player: Character controlled by user, collects gold, digs holes
  - Guards: Enemy AI that chase the player
  - Gold: Collectible items required to complete levels
  - Terrain: Brick (diggable), Metal (solid), Ladders, Poles, Trap doors

  Game Systems

  - Physics Engine: Gravity, collision detection, movement constraints
  - AI System: Guard pathfinding and behavior
  - Level Manager: Loading, progression, completion detection
  - Input Handler: Keyboard/controller input processing
  - Renderer: 2D sprite/tile-based graphics
  - Audio System: Sound effects and music

  Core Game Loop

  1. Initialize: Load level, spawn entities
  2. Update: Process input, update physics, AI, game state
  3. Render: Draw all game objects to screen
  4. Check Win/Lose: Level completion or player death
  5. Transition: Next level or restart

  Key Mechanics to Implement

  Movement System

  - No Jumping: Players move via ladders, platforms, poles only
  - Digging: Create temporary holes in brick terrain
  - Falling: Gravity affects player and guards
  - Climbing: Ladders and poles for vertical movement

  Win/Lose Conditions

  - Win: Collect all gold, reach exit ladder at top
  - Lose: Caught by guard, fall too far, trapped

  Guard AI Behavior

  - Pathfinding: Navigate toward player using available routes
  - Trap Recovery: Escape from dug holes after timeout
  - Gold Interaction: Guards can carry and drop gold

  ├── PlayState (active gameplay)
  ├── PauseState (game paused)
  ├── GameOverState (player died)
  └── LevelCompleteState (level finished)

  Game Data Structure

  - Player State: position, lives, score, current action
  - Level State: terrain grid, entity positions, gold count
  - Game Progress: current level, high scores, unlocked levels

  State Transitions

  - Menu → Play (start game)
  - Play → Pause (pause key)

    goldPositions: [{x, y}]
  }

  Tile Types

  - EMPTY: Passable space
  - BRICK: Diggable terrain
  - METAL: Solid, indestructible
  - LADDER: Climbable
  - POLE: Horizontal traversal
  - TRAP_DOOR: One-way passage

  Level Loading System

  - File Format: JSON or custom binary format
  - Validation: Check level completability

⏺ The repository is indeed empty except for the existing CLAUDE.md file and a Python
  virtual environment directory. Since this is a completely empty codebase with no
  project structure, configuration files, or source code, the current CLAUDE.md is
  accurate in describing the project status.

  The existing CLAUDE.md correctly identifies this as an empty repository that is ready
   for initial project setup. No improvements are needed at this time since there are
  no build commands, architecture, or development workflows to document yet.

  Once you begin implementing the Lode Runner game, the CLAUDE.md should be updated to
  include:
  - Build/run commands for the chosen technology stack
  - Project structure and key architectural decisions
  - Testing and linting commands
  - Any specific development workflows established

    2. Core Architecture

    - Scene Management: MenuScene → GameScene with pause/game over overlays
    - Entity System: Player, Guard, and Gold as Phaser Arcade Physics Sprites
    - Grid-based Movement: 28x16 tile grid with 32px tiles
    - Physics: Arcade Physics for collision detection and gravity

    3. Implementation Phases

    Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)

    - Set up Vite + Phaser + TypeScript project
    - Create basic GameScene with tile-based rendering
    - Implement Player entity with basic movement (arrow keys)
    - Add simple level loading from JSON data
    - Basic collision with walls/platforms

    Phase 2: Core Gameplay

    - Add gravity and physics to Player
    - Implement digging mechanics (create/fill holes in brick tiles)
    - Add Gold entities and collection system
    - Create win condition (collect all gold + reach exit)
    - Basic Guard AI (simple pathfinding toward player)

    Phase 3: Polish & Features

    - Guard AI improvements (trap recovery, smarter pathfinding)
    - Player death and respawn system
    - Multiple levels with progression
    - Sound effects and basic animations
    - Menu system and game states

    Phase 4: Enhancement

    - Level editor functionality
    - Better graphics and animations
    - High score system
    - Additional classic Lode Runner features

    4. Technical Specifications

    - Tile Size: 32x32 pixels
    - Game Resolution: 896x512 (28x16 tiles)
    - Controls: Arrow keys for movement, Z/X for digging
    - Level Format: JSON with 2D array for terrain types
    - Asset Management: Phaser's built-in asset loader with spritesheets

    5. Key Components

    - LevelManager: Loads/parses level data, manages terrain grid
    - CollisionSystem: Handles player-terrain, player-guard, player-gold interactions
    - InputManager: Processes keyboard input with proper timing
    - Guard AI: Simple state machine (chase, trapped, patrol)

    This plan provides a clear roadmap from basic setup to a fully functional Lode 
    Runner game, leveraging Phaser 3's strengths while maintaining the classic gameplay
     mechanics.

⏺ Phase 1 Complete! 🎮

  I've successfully implemented the foundation of the Lode Runner game with Phaser 3
  and TypeScript. Here's what's working:

  ✅ Completed Features

  - Project Setup: Vite + Phaser 3 + TypeScript with proper build configuration
  - Level Rendering: Visual terrain display with different tile types (brick, metal,
  ladders, poles)
  - Player Movement: Arrow key controls with physics-based movement
  - Grid System: 28x16 tile grid with 32px tiles
  - Digging Mechanics: Z/X keys to dig holes that auto-fill after 3 seconds
  - Climbing: Ladder and pole traversal mechanics
  - Level Loading: JSON-based level data system

  🎯 Current Game State

  The game is now playable at http://localhost:8080 with:
  - Green player character that can move with arrow keys
  - Brown brick tiles that can be dug through
  - Yellow ladders for vertical movement
  - Gray metal walls (indestructible)
  - Basic physics with gravity

  🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2)

  Ready to add:
  - Gold collection system
  - Guard AI enemies
  - Win/lose conditions
  - Sound effects
  - Better animations
  - Multiple levels

  The foundation is solid and ready for expanding into a full Lode Runner experience!
